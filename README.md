🔖In my studies so far, I have seen the mitochondria 🦠come up time and 
again in relation to energy 🔋 imbalances and inflammation and hope to study this further. 
🪢Aggregated proteins appear to interfere with the mitochondria and lead 
to other aggregations which have been shown to induce 🫧 Lipid dysfunction.

❓Could mitochondria 🦠 possibly lay at the center of neurodegenerative diseases like AD?
